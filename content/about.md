      Reminiscent of late â€˜90s punk
      with elements of spoken word combed through,
      Teacup Gorilla never fails to put the moodiness
      to their heavy indie-rock.

      Teacup Gorilla's amiable creative approach,
      unorthodox roots, and sense of community
      have resulted in a sound that is difficult to pin down --
      part instrumental rock, part glam, part psychedelic, part jazz-inflected.
      And it sounds like nothing much else in this highly imitative era.
